# REINFORCE ALGORITHM ON CARTPOLE

The code for REINFORCE is taken from the book [Foundations of Deep Reinfocement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-deep/9780135172490/)

I will explain more about the code and algorithm in a tutorial.

# What does this code do?

- OpenAI Gym provides an environment for CartPole game.
- _REINFORCE_ algorithm is Policy base Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
- The actions here are distinct. viz., moving left and right.
- A simple ANN of two layers is used to approximate the policy function.
- Pytorch is used for Nural Network and training.
- We can easily modify this code to perform other tasks as well.
